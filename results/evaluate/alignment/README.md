-`alignment_hyperopt.csv`: For each configuration of hyperparameters, it contains the evaluation metrics for the entire counterfactual generation pipeline. In particular, for each sequence it tells the score (similarity between the target categories and the counterfactual targets) at k=1,5,10,20.
-`alignment_hyperopt_single_split.csv`: If the evaluation is ran with a single split in the --split parameter, then the genetic dataset generation considers that split too (which doesn't happen when the splits are multiple, since it should choose one between those). I put this in this separated file since the results may vary between this and the same evaluation containing also another split.
