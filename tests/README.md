# tests
Contains the unit tests for the majority of project functions.

The folder structure replicates the project folder structure. i.e. a test of the function `performance_evaluation/alignment/utils.py` will be in `tests/performance_evaluation/alignment/test_utils`.

The tests use the naming convention `test_MethodName_WhatShouldItDo_WhenShouldItDoThat`
